# aula.js

aula.js is a JavaScript library designed to provide a robust and comprehensive interface to the Aula platform. It facilitates seamless
communication with the Aula server through both the HTTP REST API and the WebSocket GATEWAY API.
This library encapsulates complex operations into intuitive, strongly-typed methods and objectsâ€”helping you interact with the platform in a
clean, predictable way.

## âœ¨ Features

- Full support for both REST and Gateway APIs
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Strongly-typed methods and interfaces using TypeScript
- Framework-agnostic: You can use aula.js in any environment that supports ES modules.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Install via npm

```bash
npm install aula.js@alpha
```

# Examples

A simple application that connects to the gateway API and logs user information:

```ts
import { GatewayClient } from "aula.js";

await using gateway = new GatewayClient()
	.withToken("<AUTH_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER>")
	.withAddress(new URL("https://localhost:5018"));

gateway.on("Ready", async event =>
{
	console.log("Client is ready!");
	console.log(`Logged in as: ${event.user.displayName}`);
});

console.log("Connecting...");
await gateway.connect();
await gateway.waitForDisconnect();
```
